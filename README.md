# Fragrance Finder 💐

This started because I was talking to a girl who’s really into perfumes (and, conveniently, so am I).  
I told her I wanted to build a website to log fragrances, pull their notes/accords, and let you add your own thoughts.  
She said: *“I would use that.”*  

So here we are: **Fragrance Finder** — powered by a Kaggle dataset, Flask, and some very questionable web development skills.  
Hopefully she falls in love with me for my mad ChatGPT wizardry, but worst case I now have a place to track my own perfumes 😂
